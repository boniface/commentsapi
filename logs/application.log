Note that this version of the driver changes the default retry behavior for non-idempotent statements: they won't be automatically retried anymore. The driver marks statements non-idempotent by default, so you should explicitly call setIdempotent(true) if your statements are safe to retry. See http://goo.gl/4HrSby for more details.
